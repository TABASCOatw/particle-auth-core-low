    @particle-network/auth-core Demo Application
  </h3>
</div>

‚ö°Ô∏è Basic demo application which uses `@particle-network/auth-core` rather than `@particle-network/auth-core-modal` to initiate social login and send transactions. This is a lower-level library and powers `@particle-network/auth-core-modal` - most additional functionality beyodn the aforementioned (login and transaction execution) will need to be built by the developer implementing this library.

üõ†Ô∏è Try the demo: https://particle-auth-core-low.replit.app

Built using **Particle Auth Core**, **TypeScript**, **Particle AA SDK**

## üîë Particle Auth Core
Particle Auth Core, a component of Particle Network's Wallet-as-a-Service, enables seamless onboarding to an application-embedded MPC-TSS/AA wallet facilitated by social login, such as Google, GitHub, email, phone number, etc. - as an alternative to Particle Auth, the Auth Core SDK comes with more control over the modal itself, application-embedded popups rather than redirects, and so on.
